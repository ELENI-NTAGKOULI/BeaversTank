# BeaversTank
Welcome to beaversTank - Our playground for building cities that stay dry and happy. Weâ€™re Marcos, Lena, Yashashvi & Samarth four students from the Masters in AI for Architecture & Built Environment (IAAC, Barcelona), and weâ€™ve teamed up to tackle floods the way real beavers do: with brains and a bit of cheeky engineering.

Inside this repo youâ€™ll find two AI sidekicks working together. One (NSGA optimizer) sketches out smart layouts - think ponds, ridges and green sponge zones - while the other (a reinforcement-learning agent) learns when to open gates or fire up pumps as storms roll in. Grab the notebooks, run the demo, and help us keep the water where it belongs: out of the living room and in the scenery. ðŸ¦«
